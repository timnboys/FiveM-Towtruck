JB is Tonya Wiggins' boyfriend and an old friend of Franklin.   
He has a job as a tow truck driver alongside with Tonya, but his addiction to crack causes him to slack off on the business.   
Because of this, Franklin has helped the couple in the past driving JB's tow truck.  
Now it is your turn to help them out.
